/* This class implements a stemmer, which converts words into their roots. Very
   important in text processing, it allows code to handle different variants of
   a word as though they were the same, leading to cleaner results. It also
   reduces compute, by reducing the number of dimension of the word-space
   spanned by documents.

   Many different stemmer algorithms exist. All have different tradeoffs
   between speed, false positives, and false negatives. This code implements
   the Porter algorithm, the most widely used. Its quite fast and resonably
   accurate.

   The Porter algorithm works based on pattern recognition. It looks for words
   matching certain patterns, and then manipulates the word based on the
   results. The matching is done in multiple phases, so a word may be
   manipulated multiple times. The goal is to remove all suffuxes, leaving just
   the root. The root may not be an actual English word, which does not affect
   subsequent clustering as long as it is consistent.
