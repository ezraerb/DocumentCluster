/* This file is part of DocumentCluster, a program for clustering text
   documents based on similarity. To use, specify the number of clusters
   followed by the documents, which must be located in the data subdirectory.
   Stopwords are eliminated by filtering the document contents against
   stopwords.txt in the same directory. Words are stemmed using the Porter
   Stemming algorithm. k-means clustering based on cosine similarity is used
   for the clustering.

/* This class takes a list of documents, the corpus to analyze, and returns the
   document-word matrix of TF-IDF values for each significant word. The matrix
   is sparse, so it is represented as an array of linked lists. The lists are
   sorted to ensure the words are in the same order for each document

   TF-IDF stands for 'term frequency - inverse document frequency', a very
   common measurement value in text analysis. It takes the normalized frequency
   of a worde in a document and divides it by a measure of how many documents it
   appears in. The higher the value, the more significant a word is for
   processing purposes */
/* Data design overview: The data structures for this class are complicated.
   Downstream code needs to know values about the significant words in each
   document, so the logical structure is a matrix with documents as the rows
   and the words as the columns.
       Very few words appear in all documents, so the resulting matrix is
   sparse. Sparse matrixes implemented with regular matrix data structures are
   both inefficient and memory hogs. The solution is to collapse one dimension
   or the other to a list of index value - cell value pairs. Different designs
   for doing this exist, each of which has diffferent tradeoffs for different
   matrix operations. This class uses a data structure with collapsed columns,
   so it is indexed by document. Accessing it by word is complicated enough to
   have a seperate class for it.
       The other decision to make is whether to extract data from the files
   sorted in word order, or to sort it afterward. Sorting it afterward is
   significantly cheaper because many words appear in each document multiple
   times, and unsorted words can be accessed with a hashtable. */
