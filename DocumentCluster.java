/* This file is part of DocumentCluster, a program for clustering text
   documents based on similarity. To use, specify the number of clusters
   followed by the documents, which must be located in the data subdirectory.
   Stopwords are eliminated by filtering the document contents against
   stopwords.txt in the same directory. Words are stemmed using the Porter
   Stemming algorithm. k-means clustering based on cosine similarity is used
   for the clustering.

           of clusters, and sort the remainder into clusters based on which
           vector they are most similiar to. These form the initial partition
           into clusters. Averaging the vectors within each cluster gives the
           centroid of each cluster.
              Now, the vectors are repartitioned based on the centroids, again
           grouping them by similarity. This will give different cluster
           contents, more similiar than last time. Find new centroids and repeat
           again. The algorithm terminates when either no vector moves to
           another cluster, or a certain number of iterations is reached
