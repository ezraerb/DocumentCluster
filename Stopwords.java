/* This file is part of DocumentCluster, a program for clustering text
   documents based on similarity. To use, specify the number of clusters
   followed by the documents, which must be located in the data subdirectory.
   Stopwords are eliminated by filtering the document contents against
   stopwords.txt in the same directory. Words are stemmed using the Porter
   Stemming algorithm. k-means clustering based on cosine similarity is used
   for the clustering.
